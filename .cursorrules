You are an expert software engineer with extensive experience in Python, Bash scripting, Docker, web development, and n8n workflow automation.

## Project: AI News Tracker and Video Idea Generator

### Architecture

- Python scripts scrape AI news from RSS feeds, social media, and AI company events
- Python scripts summarize news using AI
- Python scripts generate video ideas from summaries
- Leonardo AI API generates video thumbnails for each idea
- Modern, high-tech web page displays feed of news stories and video suggestions with thumbnails
- Navigation menu sections: 'n8n Dashboard', 'Rationale / Workflow', 'Video Ideas', 'Output Feed'
- Clickable link to n8n dashboard (Docker container on same VPS)

### Tech Stack

- Python app with Flask, feedparser, transformers, leonardo-api
- Node.js web server (Express) for frontend
- n8n for workflow automation
- All components in Docker containers: Python app, Web server, n8n
- Docker Compose manages networks, volumes, and dependencies
- Automation via cron/Bash scripts that execute Python scripts and POST to n8n webhooks

### Development & Deployment

- Develop locally in Docker (WSL2 + Ubuntu + Docker Desktop)
- Deploy to Linux VPS via SSH and bash terminal
- Include local initial setup steps in documentation
- Include post-development deployment steps
- Document VPS sysadmin commands

### Key Files

- TODO.md - Complete step-by-step implementation guide
- docker-compose.yml - Full stack orchestration
- Dockerfile.python, Dockerfile.web - Container images
- app/main.py - Flask API endpoints
- web/public/index.html, css/style.css, js/app.js - Frontend
- app/scripts/run_pipeline.sh - Bash orchestration

- deployment/vps-commands.md - Admin reference

### Development Environment

- OS: Windows 11 with WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- Shell: Bash in WSL2 (not Git Bash)
- Editor: Cursor + VS Code Remote WSL
- Version Control: Git in WSL2 bash
- Docker: Docker Desktop with WSL2 integration

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase-Based Development with Checkpoints

**You must follow this workflow for every phase:**

1. **Phase Checkin (START OF PHASE)**

   - Announce the current phase name and number
   - List the specific TODO steps you will complete in this phase
   - Explain what files will be created or modified
   - Ask the user: "Ready to proceed with Phase X?" (pause for confirmation)
   - Do NOT proceed with implementation until user confirms

2. **Implementation (DURING PHASE)**

   - Create files, write code, and follow TODO steps precisely
   - Provide clear output of what was created/modified
   - Use code artifacts for substantial files (>20 lines)
   - Show file paths and names explicitly

3. **Phase Completion (END OF PHASE)**
   - Summarize all changes made during this phase
   - List all new/modified files
   - Provide git commit suggestion: `git add . && git commit -m "Phase X: [description]"`
   - Provide verification commands to test the phase locally (if applicable)
   - Ask the user: "Phase X complete. Review changes and commit when ready. Confirm when you want to proceed to Phase Y."
   - STOP and wait for user confirmation before moving to next phase

### Example Checkin Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE X: [Phase Name]
═══════════════════════════════════════════

I will complete the following TODO steps:
- Step N: [description]
- Step N+1: [description]
- Step N+2: [description]

Files to be created/modified:
- app/config/settings.py (create)
- app/config/__init__.py (create)
- app/scripts/rss_scraper.py (create)
- docker-compose.yml (create)

This phase will: [brief explanation of what this achieves]

Ready to proceed? (yes/no)
```

### Example Completion Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE X COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Changes made:
✅ Created app/config/settings.py
✅ Created app/config/__init__.py
✅ Created app/scripts/rss_scraper.py
✅ Created docker-compose.yml

Suggested git commit:
git add . && git commit -m "Phase X: Project structure and initial configuration"

Verification commands:
- docker-compose config   # Validate docker-compose syntax
- ls -la app/            # Verify directory structure

Next: Phase X+1: [Next Phase Name]

Ready to proceed? (yes/no)
```

## Code & Step Guidelines

When providing code or steps, ensure they are:

1. WSL2/Linux bash compatible
2. Docker-aware (container paths, volume mounts, networking)
3. Suitable for both local development and VPS deployment
4. Precise and atomic (avoid vague instructions)
5. Follow TODO.md step numbers exactly

### Important Notes

- Each phase should feel like a logical, testable unit of work
- User can review git diffs between phases
- User can revert with `git reset --hard` if issues arise
- Phases are checkpoint-driven, not continuous
- Always wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding to next phase

## Commit Strategy and Professional Development

### Commit Granularity

- **Phases may require multiple commits**: A phase is a logical grouping, not a single commit
- **One concern per commit**: Each commit should address a single, focused concern
- **Reviewable size**: Commits should be small enough to review easily (typically 1-3 files, rarely more than 5)
- **Logical grouping**: Group related files together (e.g., config files, related modules, tests with code)

### Modular Development Approach

- **One thing at a time**: Only create/modify files needed for the current feature
- **Incremental progress**: Build features incrementally, commit frequently
- **Dependencies first**: Create foundational code before code that depends on it
- **Skip placeholders**: Don't create placeholder/dummy files until they're actually needed

### Pre-Commit Check-Ins

- **Major commits**: For substantial work (>3 files or complex logic), discuss scope and approach first
- **Minor commits**: For small, focused changes (1-2 files), proceed directly
- **Check-in format**: Present plan, file list, and rationale before implementation
- **Treat as PR review**: Pre-commit discussions are like pull request reviews - get approval before proceeding

### Commit Planning

- **Break down phases**: Analyze phase requirements and propose commit structure
- **Logical progression**: Order commits by dependencies (foundation → features → tests)
- **Independent units**: Each commit should be independently testable and reviewable
- **Professional practices**: Consider code review, maintainability, and git history quality

### When to Discuss vs. Proceed

- **Discuss when**:
  - Creating new modules or major features (>3 files)
  - Uncertain about approach or scope
  - Multiple implementation options exist
  - Breaking new ground (new patterns, external APIs)
- **Proceed directly when**:
  - Small, focused changes (1-2 files)
  - Following established patterns
  - Clear, straightforward implementation
  - User explicitly says "proceed" or "no need to confirm"

### Commit Message Format

- **Single-line messages**: Use concise, descriptive single-line commit messages
- **Format**: `git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`
- **Examples**:
  - `"Add RSS feed scraper module"`
  - `"Add core feed endpoints"`
  - `"Add API tests for Flask endpoints"`
- **Avoid**: Multi-line commit messages or detailed explanations in commit message

### Git Workflow

- **Suggest commit commands**: Always provide suggested git commit commands after completing work
- **User executes**: User will execute git commands themselves when ready
- **User control**: If user explicitly says they'll handle git, respect that and don't execute git commands
- **Commit suggestions**: Format as `git add <files> && git commit -m "message"` for user's convenience

### Commit-Level Check-Ins (for major commits within phases)

When a phase requires multiple commits, use this format for each major commit:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
COMMIT X: [Commit Name]
═══════════════════════════════════════════

I will create/modify:
- file1.py (create) - [brief description]
- file2.py (modify) - [brief description]

This commit will: [what it achieves]

Dependencies: [what this depends on]

Ready to proceed? (yes/no)
```
