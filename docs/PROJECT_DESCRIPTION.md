# AI News Tracker - Project Description

## 300-Word Description

**AI News Tracker** is an automated AI news aggregation and video idea generation platform that solves the problem of information overload in the fast-moving AI space. Built with modern web technologies and hosted on Hostinger VPS, it continuously monitors RSS feeds, social media, and AI company announcements to deliver curated, summarized news with AI-generated video concepts.

The system operates on a fully automated pipeline: Python scripts scrape news from multiple sources every 6 hours, AI models (including Llama 3.2) summarize articles, and a custom video idea generator transforms summaries into actionable content concepts. Each idea comes with a unique thumbnail generated via Leonardo AI API, creating a complete content package ready for production.

The architecture leverages Docker containers for isolation and scalability, with a Flask API backend, Express.js web server, and n8n workflow automation orchestrating the entire process. The modern, high-tech UI displays news in an intuitive feed format, with dedicated sections for video ideas, workflow rationale, and n8n dashboard integration.

What sets this apart is the end-to-end automation: from news discovery to video concept delivery, everything runs without manual intervention. The system is production-ready, with Nginx reverse proxy, SSL support, automated model downloads, and comprehensive error handling. It's designed for content creators, marketers, and AI enthusiasts who need to stay ahead of AI trends without the manual research overhead.

Built with Python, Node.js, Docker, and n8n, and fully deployed on Hostinger infrastructure, AI News Tracker demonstrates modern DevOps practices, containerization, and automated workflow orchestration at scale.
